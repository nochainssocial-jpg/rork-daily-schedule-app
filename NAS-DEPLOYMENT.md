# Daily Schedule App - NAS Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your App is Complete and Ready!

Your Daily Schedule App is fully functional with:
- ✅ Complete React Native Expo app with all features
- ✅ Backend server with tRPC integration
- ✅ Schedule management, staff assignments, and sharing
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Data persistence with AsyncStorage

## 🚀 How to Run Your App on NAS

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Server Start
```bash
node server.js
```

### Option 3: Manual Expo Start
```bash
npx expo start --web --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The issue was that your NAS was serving a static HTML page instead of your actual React Native app. The new setup:

1. **Removed conflicting files** that were causing `__dirname` errors
2. **Simplified server.js** to properly run Expo web server
3. **Fixed Node.js compatibility** issues with your NAS environment
4. **Cleaned up startup scripts** to avoid confusion

## 📱 Your App Features

Your app includes all the functionality you requested:
- **Schedule Management**: Create, edit, and manage daily schedules
- **Staff & Participant Management**: Add/remove team members
- **Time Slot Assignments**: Automatic assignment of staff to time slots
- **Chore Management**: Weekly chore rotation system
- **Drop-offs & Pickups**: Manage transportation assignments
- **PDF Generation**: Export schedules as PDF
- **Schedule Sharing**: Share schedules with 6-digit codes
- **Backend Integration**: Full tRPC backend for data persistence

## 🌐 Access Your App

Once running, access your app at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://[YOUR-NAS-IP]:3000

Replace `[YOUR-NAS-IP]` with your actual NAS IP address.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Node.js version**: `node --version` (should be 20.9.0 or higher)
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Check port availability**: Make sure port 3000 is not in use
4. **Firewall**: Ensure port 3000 is open in your NAS firewall
